                </header>

                <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages interactive
                    (e.x. having complex animations, clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.). There are also more
                    advanced
                    server side versions of JavaScript such as Node.Js which allow you to add more functionality to a
                    website than simply downloading files (such as realtime collaboration between multiple computers).
                    Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects
                    of
                    its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>

                <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as <span>Array</span>, <span>Date</span>,
                    and
                    <span>Math</span>, and a core set of
                    language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be
                    extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>

                <ul class="main-section__list">
                    <li class="main-section__list-items">Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by
                        supplying objects to control a browser and
                        its
                        Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
                        elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page
                        navigation.</li>
                    <li class="main-section__list-items">Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by
                        supplying objects relevant to running
                        JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate
                        with a database, provide
                        continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file
                        manipulations on a
                        server.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This means that in the browser, JavaScript can change the way the webpage (DOM) looks. And,
                    likewise,
                    Node.js JavaScript on the server can respond to custom requests from code written in the browser.</p>

                    <h1>JavaScript and Java</h1>
                </header>

                <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The
                    JavaScript
                    language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript
                    follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was
                    the
                    reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>

                <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a
                    runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string
                    values.
                    JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model.
                    The
                    prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for
                    individual
                    objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions
                    can
                    be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.</p>

                <p>JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables,
                    classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or
                    protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return
                    types are not explicitly typed.</p>

                <p>Java is a class-based programming language designed for fast execution and type safety. Type safety
                    means, for instance, that you can't cast a Java integer into an object reference or access private
                    memory by corrupting Java bytecodes. Java's class-based model means that programs consist
                    exclusively
                    of classes and their methods. Java's class inheritance and strong typing generally require tightly
                    coupled object hierarchies. These requirements make Java programming more complex than JavaScript
                    programming.</p>

                <p>In contrast, JavaScript descends in spirit from a line of smaller, dynamically typed languages such
                    as
                    HyperTalk and dBASE. These scripting languages offer programming tools to a much wider audience
                    because
                    of their easier syntax, specialized built-in functionality, and minimal requirements for object
                    creation.</p>

                <h3>JavaScript compared to Java</h3>

                <h4>JavaScript:</h4>
                <ul class="main-section__list">
                    <li>Object-oriented. No distinction between types of objects. Inheritance is through the prototype
                        mechanism, and properties and methods can be added to any object dynamically.</li>
                    <li>Variable data types are not declared (dynamic typing, loosely typed).</li>
                    <li>Cannot automatically write to hard disk.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Java:</h4>
                <ul class="main-section__list">
                    <li>Class-based. Objects are divided into classes and instances with all inheritance through the
                        class
                        hierarchy. Classes and instances cannot have properties or methods added dynamically.</li>
                    <li>Variable data types must be declared (static typing, strongly typed)</li>
                    <li>Can automatically write to hard disk.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>JavaScript documentation versus the ECMAScript specification</h2>

                <p>The ECMAScript specification is a set of requirements for implementing ECMAScript; it is useful if
                    you
                    want to implement standards-compliant language features in your ECMAScript implementation or engine
                    (such as SpiderMonkey in Firefox, or V8 in Chrome).</p>

                <p>The ECMAScript document is not intended to help script programmers; use the JavaScript documentation
                    for
                    information on writing scripts.</p>

                <p>The ECMAScript specification uses terminology and syntax that may be unfamiliar to a JavaScript
                    programmer. Although the description of the language may differ in ECMAScript, the language itself
                    remains the same. JavaScript supports all functionality outlined in the ECMAScript specification.</p>

                <p>The JavaScript documentation describes aspects of the language that are appropriate for a JavaScript
                    programmer.</p>

                <header>
                    <h1>Tools</h1>
                </header>

                <p>Getting started with JavaScript is easy: all you need is a modern Web browser. This guide includes
                    some
                    JavaScript features which are only currently available in the latest versions of Firefox, so using
                    the
                    most recent version of Firefox is recommended.</p>

                <p>There are two tools built into Firefox that are useful for experimenting with JavaScript: the Web
                    Console and Scratchpad.</p>

                <h2>The Web Console</h2>
                <p>The <a class="section-link" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Web_Console">Web
                        Console</a> shows you
                    information about the currently loaded Web page, and also includes a command
                    line that you can use to execute JavaScript expressions in the current page.</p>

                <p>To open the Web Console (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd> on Windows and Linux or <kbd>Cmd</kbd>-<kbd>Option</kbd>-<kbd>K</kbd>
                    on Mac), select "Web Console"
                    from the "Developer" menu, which is under the "Tools" menu in Firefox. It appears at the bottom of
                    the
                    browser window. Along the bottom of the console is a command line that you can use to enter
                    JavaScript,
                    and the output appears in the panel above:</p>

                <img src="img/web-console-commandline.png" alt="placeholder image">

                <p>The console works the exact same way as eval: the last expression entered is returned. For the sake
                    of
                    simplicity, it can be imagined that every time something is entered into the console, it is actual
                    surrounded by console.log around eval like so.</p>

                <code>
                    function greetMe(yourName) {<br>
                    alert('Hello ' + yourName);<br>
                    }<br>
                    console.log(eval('3 + 5'));<br>
                </code>

                <h2>Scratchpad</h2>
                <p>The Web Console is great for executing single lines of JavaScript, but although you can execute
                    multiple
                    lines, it's not very convenient for that, and you can't save your code samples using the Web
                    Console.
                    So for more complex examples <a class="section-link" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Scratchpad">Scratchpad</a>
                    is a better tool.</p>

                <p>To open Scratchpad (<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F4</kbd>), select "Scratchpad" from the "Developer" menu,
                    which is under the menu in
                    Firefox. It opens in a separate window and is an editor that you can use to write and execute
                    JavaScript in the browser. You can also save scripts to disk and load them from disk.</p>

                <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world"
                    JavaScript code:</p>

                <code>
                    (function(){<br>
                    "use strict";<br>
                    /* Start of your code */<br>
                    function greetMe(yourName) {<br>
                    alert('Hello ' + yourName);<br>
                    }<br>

                    greetMe('World');<br>
                    /* End of your code */<br>
                    })();<br>
                </code>

                <p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser! In the following
                    pages,
                    this guide will introduce you to the JavaScript syntax and language features, so that you will be
                    able
                    to write more complex applications. But, for the time being, remember to always include the
                    (function(){"use strict"; before your code, and add })(); to the end of your code. You will learn
                    what
                    these mean, but for now they can be thought of as doing the following â€”</p>

                </header>

                <p>JavaScript borrows most of its syntax from Java, but is also influenced by Awk, Perl and Python.</p>

                <p>JavaScript is <span>case-sensitive</span> and uses the <span>Unicode</span> character set. For
                    example,
                    the word FrÃ¼h (which means
                    "early" in German) could be used as a variable name.</p>

                <code>
                    var FrÃ¼h = "foobar";
                </code>

                <p>But, the variable frÃ¼h is not the same as FrÃ¼h because JavaScript is case sensitive.</p>

                <p>In JavaScript, instructions are called statements and are separated by semicolons (;).</p>

                <p>A semicolon is not necessary after a statement if it is written on its own line. But if more than
                    one
                    statement on a line is desired, then they must be separated by semicolons. ECMAScript also has
                    rules
                    for automatic insertion of semicolons (<a class="section-link" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical_grammar#Automatic_semicolon_insertion">ASI</a>)
                    to end statements. (For more information, see the detailed
                    reference about JavaScript's <a class="section-link" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical_grammar">
                        lexical grammar</a>.) It is considered best practice, however, to always write
                    a semicolon after a statement, even when it is not strictly needed. This practice reduces the
                    chances
                    of bugs getting into the code.</p>

                <p>The source text of JavaScript script gets scanned from left to right and is converted into a
                    sequence of
                    input elements which are tokens, control characters, line terminators, comments, or whitespace.
                    Spaces,
                    tabs, and newline characters are considered whitespace.</p>

                <hr class="h-rule">

                <p>The syntax of <span>comments</span> is the same as in C++ and in many other languages:</p>

                <code>
                    // a one line comment<br>

                    /* this is a longer,<br>
                    * multi-line comment<br>
                    */<br>

                    /* You can't, however, /* nest comments */ SyntaxError */<br>
                </code>

                <p>Comments behave like whitespace and are discarded during script execution.</p>

            <section id="Declarations" class="main-section">

                <header>
                    <h1>Declarations</h1>
                </header>

                <p>There are three kinds of declarations in JavaScript.</p>

                <p><a class="section-link" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/var">var</a><br>

                    Declares a variable, optionally initializing it to a value.</p>

                <p><a class="section-link" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let">let</a><br>

                    Declares a block-scoped, local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.</p>

                <p><a class="section-link" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const">const</a><br>

                    Declares a block-scoped, read-only named constant.</p>

                <h2>Variables</h2>

                <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called
                    identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>

                <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent
                    characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the
                    characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>

                <p>You can use most of ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as Ã¥ and Ã¼ in identifiers (for more details
                    see
                    <a class="section-link" href="https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/javascript-identifiers-es6">this blog
                        post</a>). You can
                    also
                    use the <a class="section-link" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical_grammar#String_literals">Unicode
                        escape sequences</a> as characters in identifiers.</p>

                <p>Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, $credit, and _name.</p>

                <h2>Declaring variables</h2>

                <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:</p>

                <ul class="main-section__list">
                    <li>With the keyword var. For example, var x = 42. This syntax can be used to declare both local
                        and
                        global variables.</li>
                    <li>By simply assigning it a value. For example, x = 42. If this form is used outside of a
                        function, it
                        declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this
                        variant.</li>
                    <li>With the keyword let. For example, let y = 13. This syntax can be used to declare a block-scope
                        local variable. See Variable scope below.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Evaluating variables</h2>

                <p>A variable declared using the var or let statement with no assigned value specified has the value of
                    <a class="section-link" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/undefined">undefined</a>.</p>
                <p>An attempt to access an undeclared variable results in a <a class="section-link" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/ReferenceError">ReferenceError</a>
                    exception being thrown:</p>

                <code>
                    var a;<br>
                    console.log('The value of a is ' + a); // The value of a is undefined<br>

                    console.log('The value of b is ' + b); // The value of b is undefined<br>
                    var b;<br>

                    console.log('The value of c is ' + c); // Uncaught ReferenceError: c is not defined<br>

                    let x;<br>
                    console.log('The value of x is ' + x); // The value of x is undefined<br>

                    console.log('The value of y is ' + y); // Uncaught ReferenceError: y is not defined<br>
                    let y;<br>
                </code>

                <p>You can use undefined to determine whether a variable has a value. In the following code, the
                    variable
                    input is not assigned a value, and the if statement evaluates to true.</p>

                <code>
                    var input;<br>
                    if (input === undefined) {<br>
                    doThis();<br>
                    } else {<br>
                    doThat();<br>
                    }<br>
                </code>

                <p>The undefined value behaves as false when used in a boolean context. For example, the following code
                    executes the function myFunction because the myArray element is undefined:</p>

                <code>
                    var myArray = [];<br>
                    if (!myArray[0]) myFunction();
                </code>

                <p>The undefined value converts to NaN when used in numeric context.</p>

                <code>
                    var a;<br>
                    a + 2; // Evaluates to NaN
                </code>

                <p>When you evaluate a null variable, the null value behaves as 0 in numeric contexts and as false in
                    boolean contexts. For example:</p>

                <code>
                    var n = null;<br>
                    console.log(n * 32); // Will log 0 to the console
                </code>
