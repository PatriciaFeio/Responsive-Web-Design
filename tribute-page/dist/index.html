                <li><span>1903</span> - Blair, Eric Arthur [pseud. George Orwell] was
                    born in Motihari, Bengal, India.</li>
                <li><span>1911</span> - After returning with his parents to England, he was sent in 1911 to a
                    preparatory boarding school on the Sussex coast. He was later to tell of the miseries of those
                    years in his posthumously published autobiographical essay,<span class="italic">Such, Such Were the
                        Joys</span>.</li>
                <li><span> 1917 - 1921</span> - Won scholarships to two of England’s leading schools, Winchester and
                    Eton, and chose the latter. It was there that he published his first writing in college
                    periodicals.</li>
                <li><span>1922</span> - Went to Burma as assistant district superintendent in the Indian Imperial
                    Police. Later he was to recount his experiences and his reactions to imperial rule in his novel
                    <span class="italic">Burmese Days</span> and in two brilliant autobiographical sketches, “Shooting
                    an Elephant” and “A Hanging,” classics of expository prose.</li>
                <li><span>1928</span> - Resigned from the imperial police. After this he choose to immerse himself in
                    the life of the poor and outcast people of Europe.</li>
                <li><span>1933</span> - Publishes <span class="italic">Down and Out in Paris and London</span>, where
                    he recounted in fictional form his experiences among the poor.</li>
                <li><span>1934</span> - Publishes his first novel, <span class="italic">Burmese Days</span>.</li>
                <li><span>1935</span> - Publishes <span class="italic">A Clergyman’s Daughter</span>.</li>
                <li><span>1936</span> - Publishes <em>Keep the Aspidistra Flying</em>.</li>
                <li><span>1937</span> - Publishes <span class="italic"> The Road to Wigan Pier</span>, his first
                    socialist book, an original and unorthodox political treatise, where he combines mordant reporting
                    with a tone of generous anger that was to characterize Orwell’s subsequent writing.</li>
                <li><span>1938</span> - Writes <span class="italic">Homage to Catalonia</span>, a vivid account of his
                    experience during the Spanish Civil War.</li>
                <li><span>1939</span> - In his next novel, <span class="italic">Coming Up for Air</span>, he shows a
                    paradoxically conservative strain.</li>
                <li><span>1941 - 1943</span> - Works on propaganda for the BBC.</li>
                <li><span>1943</span> - Orwell becomes literary editor of the Tribune, a left-wing socialist paper.</li>
                <li><span>1944</span> - Orwell finishes <span class="italic">Animal Farm</span>, a political fable
                    based on the story of the Russian Revolution and its betrayal by Joseph Stalin. At first Orwell had
                    difficulty finding a publisher for the small masterpiece, but when it appeared in 1945, <span class="italic">Animal
                        Farm</span> made him famous and, for the first time, prosperous.</li>
                <li><span>1949</span> - Publishes his last book, <span class="italic">Nineteen Eighty-four</span>, a
                    novel he wrote as a warning after years of brooding on the twin menaces of Nazism and Stalinism.
                    The novel is set in an imaginary future in which the world is dominated by three perpetually
                    warring totalitarian police states.</li>
                <li><span>1950</span> - Dies from tuberculosis in a London hospital.</li>

        <blockquote class="long-blockquote">
            <p class="long-blockquote__paragraph">What Orwell's experiences – both as figure of authority and as
                scullion – had given him was a lived
                understanding of the human condition. It was this grounding in reality that bestowed a more profound
                political instinct than would be available to some sloganeering zealot. He had acquired a capacity to
                empathise with the foot-soldiers of history, the put-upon people generally taken for granted, ignored
                or squashed by the great isms of one sort or another. It conferred upon him the remarkable ability to
                achieve what every journalist and essayist seeks.
                <br>He could tell the truth.
